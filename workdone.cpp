/*
Implement a problem of minimum work to be done
per day to finish given tasks within D days problem.
Statement: Given an array task[] of size N denoting
amount of work to be done for each task, the problem
is to find the minimum amount of work to be done on
each day so that all the tasks can be completed in at
most D days. Note: On one day work can be done for
only one task.
Input: task[] = [3, 4, 7, 15],  D = 10
Output: 4
Input: task[] = [30, 20, 22, 4, 21], D = 6
Output: 22
